# 🧪 IT Practices by Ignacio

Welcome to my public collection of technical hands-on practices as I transition into the world of IT and cybersecurity.
This repository documents my personal learning process in areas like:

- 💻 Linux fundamentals
- 🔐 Cybersecurity basics
- 🖥️ Virtual machines and system setup
- 🛠️ Tools like ClamAV, Wireshark, Nmap, etc.
- 🔍 Real-world inspired analysis exercises

Each folder contains a specific practice, documented with:
- Clear goals and tools used
- Step-by-step procedures
- Lessons learned
- Screenshots (when relevant)

🗂 Naming follows this format: `practice-XXXX-[title]`

📖 Most practices are written in English, but you’ll find links to bilingual (English/Spanish) versions on Notion as well.

> I built this repo as a way to show consistency, curiosity, and practical skills—nothing fancy, just real learning.
