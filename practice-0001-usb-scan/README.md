# Practice #0001 ‚Äì Safe Analysis of Suspicious USB Drive

## üéØ Goal

To safely analyze a potentially infected USB drive on a Linux system without opening or executing files, using ClamAV antivirus for static analysis.

---

## üîß Tools & Materials

- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Terminal
- USB flash drive with unknown content
- Antivirus: ClamAV
- Commands: `lsblk`, `df -h`, `clamscan`, `systemctl`, `freshclam`

---

## üìù Steps

1. Updated system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. Installed ClamAV:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install clamav -y
   ```
3. Tried to update virus DB:
   ```bash
   sudo freshclam
   ```
   ‚ùå Failed due to locked log file.
4. Fixed by stopping background service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam
   sudo freshclam
   sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam
   ```
5. Plugged in USB (did **not** open file explorer).
6. Identified mount point:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   df -h
   ```
   ‚Üí Found at `/media/ignacio/4889-7BEA`
7. Ran scan:
   ```bash
   clamscan -r /media/ignacio/4889-7BEA
   ```
   ‚úÖ No infected files found.
